- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?

I thought I understood associations, but it turns out I don't when I was programming. I still cannot tell association  relationships if more classes are presented to me.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At least I know how to write accessors... nothing else really worked if I were to do the assignment myself. My advise... ask tutors for help.
